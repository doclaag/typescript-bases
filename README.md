# Project Information

This project is a TypeScript project that serves as a base for building TypeScript applications. It provides a starting point with some basic configurations and instructions on how to use TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Install TypeScript globally by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```shell
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

2. Initialize the TypeScript configuration file by running the following command in the root of your project:

   ```shell
   tsc --init
   ```

   This will create a `tsconfig.json` file that contains the TypeScript compiler options.

3. Write your TypeScript code in `.ts` files within your project directory.

4. Compile your TypeScript code by running the following command:

   ```shell
   tsc
   ```

   This will compile all the TypeScript files in your project and generate corresponding JavaScript files.

5. Run your JavaScript code by executing the generated JavaScript files using Node.js or any other JavaScript runtime.

## Additional Commands

Here are some additional commands that you may find useful:

- `tsc -w` or `tsc --watch`: This command watches for changes in your TypeScript files and automatically recompiles them whenever a change is detected.

- `tsc --help`: This command displays the help information for the TypeScript compiler, including all available options and commands.

For more information on TypeScript and its features, refer to the official TypeScript documentation.
